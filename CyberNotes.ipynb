        "- SIEM is a technology that provides real-time analysis of security alerts generated by applications and network hardware.\n",
        "- It combines two key cybersecurity components: Security Information Management (SIM), which collects data for analysis, and Security Event Management (SEM), which analyses the data in real time and enables incident response.\n",
        "- SIEM systems aggregate relevant data from multiple sources, allowing for detection of patterns and correlations that might indicate a cyber attack or security breach"

        "- Advanced correlation and analysis of this data can reveal abnormal activity or trends that suggest a security threat, thus allowing early detection and mitigation of cyber risks.\n",
